    <h2>Beers I do and do not like</h2>
    <p>Listen, I think it's really important that you understand that when I say "Trying new kinds of beer" that I mean neither "Getting wasted with a newer, cheaper beer" nor "Trying only the finest, hippest craft brews." When I say "Trying new kinds of beer," I'm just trying to tell you that I enjoy most types of beer, and drinking them with people can be a fun experience. Also, I don't lke IPAs very much. I'm sorry.</p>
